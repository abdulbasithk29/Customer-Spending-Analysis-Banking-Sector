# Customer Spending Analysis - Banking Sector  

## Project Overview  
This project involves analyzing customer spending patterns to assist Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution, in launching a new line of credit cards. The goal is to uncover actionable insights to tailor credit card offerings to customer needs and market trends.  

AtliQ Data Services was assigned a pilot project, and I conducted this analysis using **Excel Power Query**, **Power Pivot**, and **DAX**. The dataset includes **4,000 customers** and **864,000 transactions** over six months.  

This project was conducted by Codebasics as resume project challenge(#8).
